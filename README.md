# **Digital-pharmacology-hackathon**

## Digital pharmacology hackathon at the ITMO Infochemistry Centre with Sintelli and Medtech.Moscow

This repository is the result of the collaboration between ITMO Center for Infochemistry, Sintelli, and Medtech.Moscow for the "Digital Pharmacology: Predictive Modeling" hackathon. The event took place from April 28th to April 30th, and the technological partner for this event is Selectel.

Participants had the opportunity to make breakthroughs in predictive modeling of the side effects of pharmaceutical and bioactive compounds and contribute to the development of digital methods in medicine.

## Goal
The goal of the hackathon was to build machine learning models to accurately predict parameters characterizing the toxicity of chemical compounds. Teams collected their datasets from open sources using natural language processing technologies. The winning teams demonstrated high model accuracy and its applicability to a wide range of compound classes (relevant benchmarks were provided).

## Impact
Developers and researchers in the field of medicinal chemistry need new digital methods for navigating and filtering the chemical space to design innovative and safe drugs. These methods can significantly reduce the time and resources required for the development and implementation of new bioactive compounds. Moreover, they can reduce the use of laboratory animals in experiments and minimize the risks of adverse drug effects on humans.

## Participants
The hackathon invited students in natural sciences, technical specialties, IT developers, data scientists, chemists, pharmacologists, medical professionals, toxicologists, biologists, young scientists, researchers, and R&D businesses.

## Event Details
The event took place online for 48 hours from April 28th to April 30th. Teams consisted of 2 to 5 members, and the age requirement was 18+. The prize pool included 1,000,000 rubles and other gifts. The winners had the opportunity to consider their ranking when applying for the online Master's program in Chemistry Soft and also had a chance to become part of the Sintelli team and other resident medical startups at Medtech.Moscow.

## Preparation
Participants were encouraged to prepare for the hackathon in advance by familiarizing themselves with data collection and processing technologies, studying literature and open data sources, gathering necessary datasets (the more diverse and extensive the datasets, the better the chances of building a strong model and winning), and understanding the parameters characterizing toxicity. Sets of parameters characterizing toxicity and relevant benchmarks were provided on the website.
